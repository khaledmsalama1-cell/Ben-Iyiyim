## 🚀 Features

- **Quick Status Updates**: Instantly broadcast your safety status to all registered emergency contacts.
- **Contact Management**: Keep a prioritized list of loved ones to notify during an emergency.
- **Real-Time Sync**: Uses Firebase Firestore to keep contact lists and statuses updated in real-time.
- **Clean Architecture**: Built with strict adherence to Feature-Based Clean Architecture (Presentation, Domain, Data layers).
- **Offline Capabilities**: Queues updates if the network drops and syncs immediately when connectivity is restored.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

This project strictly follows modern scalable application practices:

- **Framework**: Flutter (SDK >=3.0.0 <4.0.0)
- **State Management**: `flutter_bloc`
- **Backend Services**: Firebase Core, Auth, Firestore, Messaging, Analytics, Crashlytics, and Storage.
- **Routing**: `go_router`
- **Dependency Injection**: `get_it`
- **Functional Programming**: `dartz` (Either types for robust error handling)
- **UI & Theming**: Google Fonts, Lottie animations, Shimmer loading states, and strictly typed `ThemeData` extensions for colors, spacing, and typography.

## 🎨 UI/UX Philosophy

The app is built utilizing a heavily componentized design system. 
- **No Hardcoded Values**: Colors, spacing, and typography rely exclusively on strict theme extensions (`context.colors.primary`, `AppSpacing.md`).
- **Reusable Widgets**: All basic UI components (e.g., `AppButton`, `AppTextField`, `AppDialog`) are built as reusable `shared/widgets`.
- **Bloc-driven UI**: Complex business logic and state management are pushed entirely to Blocs, keeping the widget tree light and declarative.
